# MODULE 9 CHALLENGE "surfs_up"
## Overview of the analysis
The following analysis provides W. Avy information about temperatures during June and December. He needs this information because would like to open a surf shop and needs to know if the conditions in Oahu, Hawaii are appropiate for his business to be successful and determine if his business could be open year round. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- Average temperature
    The average temperature in December is 71.13 F whereas the average temperature in June is 75.17 F. This small variation of 4 F could be considered minimal. So it could be stated that the temperature is more or less consistent year round. 
- Minimum temperature
    The minimum temperature in December is 60 F whereas the minimum temperature in June is 64 F. There is a small temperature variation. What is unknown is if the water temperature decreases by the same amount. If the water were between 55 to 64 F surfers could use a full neoprene suit to surf comfortably. 
- Maximum temperature
    The maximum temperature in December is 78 F and in June 81 F. There is a small temperature variation. 

## Summary

While is important to know the temperature, I believe surfing conditions are more dependant on the Wind and Tide conditions than the temperature. High speed wind and strong storms make it very difficult for people to surf and also affect the tide. On a google search I found that the best weather conditions to surf in Oahu are from October to April because of the storms. Perhaps it would be a good idea to perform an additional query to know 1. storm conditions 2. wind conditions. With this information W. Avy would be better prepared to know if his shop could be open year round.
